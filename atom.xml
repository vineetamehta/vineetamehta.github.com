<p> <p> <i>Data Visualization can be a complicated set of processes to learn.</i> Finding the right way to view your data is as much an art as a science.</p>

<p>Visualization is any technique for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate a message. Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of man.Examples from history include cave paintings, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Greek geometry, and Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s revolutionary methods of technical drawing for engineering and scientific purposes.</p>

<h2>Data visualization</h2>


<p> A term usually covering both information and scientific visualization.  </p>


<p> Visualization today has ever-expanding applications in science, education, engineering (e.g., product visualization), interactive multimedia, medicine, etc. Typical of a visualization application is the field of computer graphics. The invention of computer graphics may be the most important development in visualization since the invention of central perspective in the Renaissance period. The development of animation also helped advance visualization.</p>

<h3>Scientific Visualization</h3>

<p> Scientific visualization is the transformation, selection, or representation of data from simulations or experiments, with an implicit or explicit geometric structure, to allow the exploration, analysis, and understanding of the data. Scientific visualization focuses and emphasizes the representation of higher order data using primarily graphics and animation techniques.</p>




<h3>Information Visualization</h3>

<p> Information visualization concentrates on the use of computer-supported tools to explore large amount of abstract data. The term &#8220;information visualization&#8221; was originally coined by the User Interface Research Group at Xerox PARC and included Dr. Jock Mackinlay.Practical application of information visualization in computer programs involves selecting, transforming, and representing abstract data in a form that facilitates human interaction for exploration and understanding. Important aspects of information visualization are dynamics of visual representation and the interactivity. Strong techniques enable the user to modify the visualization in real-time, thus affording unparalleled perception of patterns and structural relations in the abstract data in question.</p>




<h3>Infographics</h3>


<p> <img src="http://www.imfromthefutura.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/grd3InfoGraphicFLAT.CROP2_.jpg" border="1">
  <p>A specific sort of genre of visualizations.  Infographics have become popular on the web as a way of combining various statistics and visualizations with a narrative and, sometimes, a polemic.</p></p>

<h3>Visual Analytics</h3>


<p><img src="http://cdn.practicaldb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tableau-on-iPad.jpg" border="1"></p>

<p> The practice of using visualizations to analyze data.  In some research, visualizations can support more formal statistical tests by allowing researchers to interact with the data points directly without aggregating or summarizing them.  Even simple scatter plots, when the variables are chosen carefully, can show outliers, dense regions, bimodalities, etc. In fields where the data themselves are visual (e.g., medical fields), visual analytics may actually be the primary means of analyzing data.  The process of analyzing data through visualization is itself studied by researchers in the visual analytics field.</p>




<h3>Product Visualization</h3>

<p>Product visualization involves visualization software technology for the viewing and manipulation of 3D models, technical drawing and other related documentation of manufactured components and large assemblies of products. It is a key part of product lifecycle management. Product visualization software typically provides high levels of photorealism so that a product can be viewed before it is actually manufactured. This supports functions ranging from design and styling to sales and marketing. Technical visualization is an important aspect of product development. Originally technical drawings were made by hand, but with the rise of advanced computer graphics the drawing board has been replaced by computer-aided design (CAD). CAD-drawings and models have several advantages over hand-made drawings such as the possibility of 3-D modeling, rapid prototyping, and simulation.</p>
