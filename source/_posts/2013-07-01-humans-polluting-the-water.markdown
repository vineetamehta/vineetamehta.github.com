Water is important for all and all of us know that very well. But do we actually realize its importance.
A day of water shortage makes us realize that perfectly. All living things would die if it weren't for water. We use water for drinking, washing, cleaning, cooking, and growing our food as well as many, many other things
Water is indespensible.
 
Today water pollution is a major issue. To ensure that we and our world survive we must start caring about it. 

When toxic substances enter lakes, streams, rivers, oceans, and other water bodies, they get dissolved or lie suspended in water or get deposited on the bed. This results in the pollution of water whereby the quality of the water deteriorates, affecting aquatic ecosystems. Pollutants can also seep down and affect the groundwater deposits.


 It involves the release of toxic substances, pathogenic germs, substances that require much oxygen to decompose, easy-soluble substances, radioactivity, etc. that becomes deposited upon the bottom and their accumulations will interfere with the condition of aquatic ecosystems.


The major sources that lead to water pollution to the following categories:
* petroleum products
* synthetic agricultural chemicals
* heavy metals
* hazardous wastes
* excess organic matter
* sediment
* infectious organisms
* air pollution
* thermal pollution
* soil pollution
