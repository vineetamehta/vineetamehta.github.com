I and my project partner have been working on the IdeaDu Project as part of our summer training. We are working on the Project 'My water My condition'.While working on this Application we had come across the need of Geocoding.
Geocoding is the process of finding associated geographic coordinates (usually expressed as latitude and longitude) from other geographic data, such as addresses, or PIN codes (postal codes).

Then there is something called as reverse geocoding.As the name suggests it is just the opposite of Geocoding:finding an associated textual location such as a street address, from geographic coordinates.


So how do we start..

We have the options of using Google Maps, Maps of India ,Open Street Maps.


GPS Visualizer offers several options for geocoding your information.
